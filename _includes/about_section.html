        <p class="section__article__text text--align-center mb--2">
          With RubyConf AT we aim to gather a Ruby audience passionate about the Ruby programming language, within an atmosphere that reminds of classical Austria, merging musical performances with the program of the conference (sometimes by speakers as well).
        </p>
        <p class="section__article__text text--align-center mb--2">
          RubyConf AT is a long-term community project aimed to support and grow the Ruby community in Austria. Really, what it is, is mostly an excuse to bring together a community of Rubyists to spend some quality time together.
        </p>
        <p class="section__article__text text--align-center mb--2">
Key values around which we build this conference are: long lasting impact, free flow of artistry and creativity, passion (towards Ruby) and, most importantly, human connection.
